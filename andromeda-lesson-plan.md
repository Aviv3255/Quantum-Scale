## Lesson Sequence Logic

These lessons follow the natural flow of the Andromeda Playbook:

1. **Understanding the System** (Lesson 1) - Before you can use Andromeda, you need to understand how it works
2. **Structure Strategy** (Lesson 2) - How to organize campaigns for the new system
3. **Creative Strategy** (Lesson 3) - What types of creatives the system needs
4. **Angle Framework** (Lesson 4) - How to generate distinct creative angles
5. **Data Foundation** (Lesson 5) - The signals that power everything

## Content Approach

Each lesson will:
- Use ELI6 methodology with powerful metaphors
- Include visual mockups of Ads Manager interfaces
- Show before/after comparisons where applicable
- Include animated diagrams for complex concepts
- Word count: 450-700 words
- Accent color: #3b82f6 (blue) for Meta brand consistency

## Key Metaphors to Use
