# LESSON IMPROVEMENT NOTES
## READ THIS BEFORE EVERY IMPROVEMENT SESSION

## CRITICAL RULES

### Character GIFs/Videos
- **MAX 2 character videos per lesson** (Welcome slide NOT included)
- Welcome slide always has its own character video (from greetings.js)
- Be selective - only add character videos where they enhance the content

### Reference Lessons (STUDY THESE)
These are the elite examples to follow:
1. `biz-20-domination` - The 20% Domination Rule
2. `biz-ridge-wallet-protocol` - The Ridge Wallet Protocol
3. `biz-high-margin-fortress` - The High Margin Fortress
4. `biz-next-best-dollar` - The Next Best Dollar
5. `biz-channel-mix-formula` - The Channel Mix Formula
6. `biz-systems-architect` - The Systems Architect

### Workflow
1. READ the reference lessons before improving
2. Improve the lesson
3. QA with Playwright
4. **COMMIT changes immediately after each lesson**
5. Update tracker
6. Continue to next lesson

## DIVERSITY IS KEY - MAKE EACH LESSON UNIQUE!

### The Golden Rule
**Every lesson must feel DIFFERENT.** Don't use the same patterns for every lesson.
Each lesson has unique content - create custom components that match THAT content.

### How to Diversify
1. **Study the lesson's core concept** - What metaphor/story does it tell?
2. **Create 2-3 CUSTOM slide types** that only make sense for THIS lesson
3. **Use different visual metaphors** - not just cards and stats
4. **Match the theme** - An empathy lesson should FEEL different from a pricing lesson

### Custom Slide Ideas by Topic
- **Customer Service/Empathy**: Agent comparison panels, emotion journey, "feeling seen" visual
- **Pricing/Numbers**: Animated calculators, price tier comparisons, ROI gauges
- **Marketing/Funnels**: Funnel visualizations, conversion flow diagrams
- **Strategy**: Framework diagrams, decision trees, comparison matrices
- **Growth**: Growth curves, milestone timelines, scaling visuals

## Elite Design Patterns (USE AS FOUNDATION, NOT COPY-PASTE)

### Base Visual Components
- AnimatedCounter for statistics
- Dark gradient cards: `background: 'linear-gradient(135deg, #1a1a1a, #2d2d2d)'`
- Top accent lines: `background: 'linear-gradient(90deg, transparent, ${color}, transparent)'`
- Glow effects: `boxShadow: '0 0 30px ${color}20'`
- Colored borders: `border: '1px solid rgba(${color-rgb}, 0.3)'`

### Slide Types (minimum 8 unique per lesson)
- stat-countdown (animated numbers)
- before-after comparison
- framework-summary
- insight-card
- data visualization
- **2-3 Custom types UNIQUE to each lesson's content**

### Typography
- Fraunces serif for all headings
- Inter for body text

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Adding too many character videos (MAX 2 per lesson!)
- Not studying reference lessons first
- Forgetting to commit after each improvement
- Making changes without understanding the reference patterns
