## ORIGINAL TASK CONTEXT (DO NOT DELETE)

```
We need to start improve the design, our design must be an elite, world-class level.
0 Mistakes, 0 Visual issues. It need to be at the world's highest design levels,
award-winning design level.

Right Now, We have couple of good examples That I liked in terms of design, components, etc:

- The 20% Domination Rule (biz-20-domination)
- The Ridge Wallet Protocol (biz-ridge-wallet-protocol)
- The High Margin Fortress (biz-high-margin-fortress)
- The Next Best Dollar (biz-next-best-dollar)
- The Channel Mix Formula (biz-channel-mix-formula)
- The Systems Architect (biz-systems-architect)

This interactive lessons are pretty good in terms of the design style and components,
I need you to use them as an inspiration + Get 10 levels ABOVE, in the rest of the lessons.

Bottom line:
Make a list in the code of all our lessons name (That under the learning center page) -
And then we will start improve their design, With tight visual QA with playwright MCP
immediately after editing a slide. You will work in loop - See lesson, improve if possible
- check again with playwright, improve if possible, until perfection.

Do not touch the general text structure (If you need to change because of the new component,
that's ok you can).

Just Improve the design based on the few lessons that I gave you as an inspiration.

After finishing improving each lesson, please remove him from your list so we will know what left.
