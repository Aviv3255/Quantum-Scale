Delayed pain (you don\'t feel the loss immediately)\n2. Abstract spending (numbers on a screen, not physical loss)\n3. Easier transactions (frictionless, one-click convenience)\n4. Higher limits (credit extends your buying power)\n\nSeeing the logos activates these associations. Spending resistance decreases. Purchase likelihood increases. All without conscious awareness.' },

Add a small row of payment logos below your "Add to Cart" button on product pages\n2. Display the same logos near the total price on your cart page\n3.

Use actual logo images (Visa, MasterCard, Amex, PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay)\n6.
