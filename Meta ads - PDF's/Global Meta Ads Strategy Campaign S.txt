Global Meta Ads Strategy: Campaign Structure
Phase 1: Creative Testing
Campaign Type: 1 ABO (Ad Set Budget Optimization).

Structure: Multiple identical Ad Sets targeting broad interests (largest possible audience).

Logic: Under each Ad Set, there is only 1 unique creative.

Visual Flow (Canvas Style):

[1 ABO Campaign]

⬇️

[Ad Set 1] | [Ad Set 2] | [Ad Set 3] | [Ad Set 4]

⬇️

[Creative 1] | [Creative 2] | [Creative 3] | [Creative 4]

Note: The goal is to test as many signals as possible. Minimalist white blocks, thin black border, black text.

Phase 2: Scaling Campaign
Campaign Type: 1 CBO (Campaign Budget Optimization).

Logic: Only 1 scaling campaign is needed. It houses all high-value audiences and winning assets.

Structure (7 Ad Sets):

Top 10% Spenders (Create Audience for free)

Top 25% Spenders (Create Audience for free)

RFM Segments (Champion, Loyal, Promising) (Create Audience for free)

5% Purchase Lookalike (LLA)

6-8 Interests (The winners from the testing phase)

Open Targeting (No interests/demographics)

Advantage+ Targeting Ad Set

Creatives: Below every Ad Set, there is one single block containing: "All Winning Creatives".

Phase 3: Remarketing Campaign
Execution: Based on the specific PDF materials provided.

Placement: If the material suggests including remarketing within the main Scaling/Testing campaigns, I will follow that specific instruction while maintaining the core structure above.
